# About InVesalius

InVesalius is a public health software designed for the analysis 
and segmentation of virtual anatomical models. 
This software enables the generation of physical models through 
rapid prototyping (3D printing) using two-dimensional (2D) 
images acquired from Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). 
By converting these 2D images into three-dimensional (3D) anatomical representations, 
healthcare professionals can utilize the resulting models for various medical purposes. 
It is important to emphasize that the software is a supplementary diagnostic tool, 
and each and every act committed is the responsibility of health professionals.   
  
InVesalius is named in honour of the Belgian doctor Andreas Vesalius
(1514-1564), widely considered the father of modern anatomy. InVesalius
software has been developed by CTI (Center for Information Technology Center
Renato Archer), a unit of the Brazilian Ministry of Science and
Technology (MCT), since 2001. Initially, only the installation program
was distributed as freeware. In November 2007 InVesalius was made fully
available as free open source software via the Public Software
Portal, allowing for communities of users and developers to connect.
InVesalius stands out as a user-friendly cross-platform solution that 
effectively combines visualization technology with 3D analysis and rapid 
prototyping to aid surgeons in diagnosing and planning complex procedures.

InVesalius has demonstrated great versatility across
different fields, including medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine,
archeology and engineering. 
Its core functionality relies on processing DICOM-format medical images, 
predominantly from CT scanners and MRI machines. 
The software's capability to enhance understanding and visualization of medical 
images contributes to improved procedural comprehension and decision-making.
